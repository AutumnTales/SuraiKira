Project Alice archive. Holds the last build(s) before the 2017 refresh.

This github page serves as an archive for the build(s) of 2016. Check Skyway and Windway channels for the newest builds!


Official (2017) channels:
Skyway: https://github.com/AutumnTales/ProjectAlice-Skyway


^Skyway builds are early builds, prone to issues. These builds include new features. Only use to give feedback!

Windway: https://github.com/AutumnTales/ProjectAlice-WindWay

^Windway builds are more polished, and less prone to issues and crashes. Use these if you want a more stable experience and you don't want to be a mad scientist (or a yandere gone lovesick)

Archive of 2016 builds: This very github!
